# D4Q / desire4quiz
A custom online quiz (question & answer) framework inspired by D2L, with a default dark design. It's been designed as
a Single-page Application (SPA) written in Nuxt/Vue.js which gives it a huge performance advantage.

D4Q has two parts to it - the frontend and the backend/API. The API is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database 
for data storage.
